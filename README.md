# ITSC-320-Lab-Secure-Coding
This is the first lab of my ITSC 320 class on software security, with the first lab being about secure testing.
To open the program just run the app driver file, in the folders, it was quite easy as the instructor gave us most of the code and we had to just to finish a TODO list in the code.
